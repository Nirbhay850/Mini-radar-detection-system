# Mini-radar-detection-system
An Arduino-based radar system using ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, LCD, and laser module for object detection
this is the link to watch the working video of the project : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llFQc1aIe3BiQfF1W-H3uvdvN1mDOKtr/view?usp=sharing

i have used the following components : 
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Servo motor (SG90)
- I2C LCD display
- Laser module (KY-008)
- i 3d printed the base, the arm, the plane and the truck

  how it works :
  - Servo motor sweeps the ultrasonic sensor across angles.
  - When an object is detected under 10 cm:
  - Laser blinks
  - LCD displays distance and bar graph

I have uploaded the files and the working video if you want to refer to it.
